# MEAL RIGHT

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/lZcHN4blUQc

#### Description: "Meal Right" is a responsive calorie consumption calculation and management web application. Users can use this app to check nutrition details of their daily consumed food, calculate everydayâ€™s calorie consumption and record it forever in the diary as their consumption history. The user experience will be similar to adding goods into shopping carts. All the food nutrition data sources from USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) database. Welcome to play with this app and any feedback. I will very appreciate it.

#### Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Sqlite

 Notice: This is original version of my development process. This version uses sqlite3 as a light database for testing web app. However, since Sqlite is database management tool based on filesystem, Vercel, which is a serverless web hosting tool, cannot support it. Thus, I moved to my final production version with a lot of changes and efforts. But I still want to keep this original version.
